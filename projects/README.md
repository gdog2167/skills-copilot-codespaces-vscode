## How to Use These Projects

1. **Pick a project** that interests you
2. **Open the starter file** - it has basic structure and comments
3. **Use Copilot** to implement the features
4. **Experiment** - add your own features!
5. **Test frequently** as you build

## Tips for Building Projects

- Start with simple features and gradually add complexity
- Write clear comments describing what you want
- Break large features into smaller functions
- Test each feature before moving to the next
- Don't be afraid to try different approaches

## Your Own Projects

Feel free to create new project folders here for anything you want to build:
- Web servers
- Games
- Data processing tools
- Automation scripts
- And more!

GitHub Copilot can help with any programming task. The key is to start with a clear idea of what you want to build and break it down into smaller pieces.

Happy building! 🚀
