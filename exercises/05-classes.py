# GitHub Copilot Exercise 5: Classes and Object-Oriented Programming
#
# Practice using Copilot to create classes, methods, and object-oriented designs

# TODO: Create a BankAccount class with deposit, withdraw, and get_balance methods


# TODO: Create a Rectangle class with methods to calculate area and perimeter


# TODO: Create a Student class with name, grades list, and a method to calculate average


# TODO: Create a ShoppingCart class with methods to add items, remove items, and calculate total


# TODO: Create a Temperature class that can convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin


# TODO: Create a Book class and a Library class that manages a collection of books


# Bonus Challenge: Create a Vehicle base class and Car/Motorcycle subclasses
# with inheritance and method overriding


# Test your classes here!
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Test your classes here")
    
    # Example:
    # account = BankAccount(1000)
    # account.deposit(500)
    # print(account.get_balance())
