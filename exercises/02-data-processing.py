# GitHub Copilot Exercise 2: Data Processing with Python
# 
# In this exercise, you'll explore how Copilot can help you work with data structures,
# filtering, mapping, and transformations.
#
# Instructions: Same as Exercise 1 - write comments and let Copilot suggest code!

# Sample data for our exercises
students = [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 20, "grade": 85},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 22, "grade": 92},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 21, "grade": 78},
    {"name": "Diana", "age": 20, "grade": 95},
    {"name": "Eve", "age": 23, "grade": 88}
]
